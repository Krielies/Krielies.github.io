    <p>For the arcade game me and 1 other developer as well as 3 artists started working on a game that would fit on the arcade. For rthe artstyle we decided to go with pixel art because it fit the theme of arcade machines. Due to it being the first time most of the artists worked with pixel art, some of the art was in wrong definition and thus some were in poor resolution. The point of the game was to get to the top of the level while running away from lava and dodging demons and each time the player completed the level the enemies got a bit faster. During the making of this game I've learned how to code a lot of new things and so it was a great learning experience</p>
