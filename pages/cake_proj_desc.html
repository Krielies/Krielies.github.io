    <p>In this project me and my team were making a data visualization game. The data we visualized was data my team collected by ourself and it showed how many people were born on a day of a month in a year. So for example if i was born on the 18 of april 2002 then the data we would collect would be 18 and 2002. After we collectd over 100 dates we then started working on the game. In the game there would be big cakes and each cake represented a year. Each cake has 31 slices, each slice representing a day of a month and on each slice there would be candles representing the amount of people. For years that there were too few people which would lead to the cake being empty we decided to just make sepret slices that would have the number of dates on them. For the people that were born alone in a year we made cupcakes.</p>
