        <p>In this game I made it so that when your phone saw a picture through the camera it would spawn the game. The point of the game is to drive around in a car and dodge lasers while the lasers slowly start shooting faster. If the player loses they can easly restart by clicking on the screen. In this game i used 2 ar packages that helped set the picture detection up. I came upon the idea of the game after a lot of thinking because I couldnt figure out what type of game I wanted to make. When making the game I had to use a lot of new things which I've never used before which caused me to make a lot of mistakes. During the writing of the code the script that controlled the player movement was only partially working and since I couldn't figure out how to fix it, I added some new code to the broken part which allowed the player to move but still gave errors from the broken script. The reason I didn't remove the broken script is because it had a component that I needed. I also had small issues with arrays that i later managed to fix. Although this project had a rocky start with my unity being broken for 2 weeks it was still a pretty fun project in general.</p>
